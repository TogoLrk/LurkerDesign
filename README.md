What you will achieve by using these styles is the improved UI and UX.

Install Stylus at:

   or [beta](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus-beta/apmmpaebfobifelkijhaljbmpcgbjbdo))
2. [Firefox add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us/)

### How to install these styles

1. Make sure Stylus is installed and enabled in your browser.
2. Go to the selected style under `src` directory, open the selected style, and click `Raw`.
3. Stylus should recognize the style and ask if you want to install it - proceed.
   1. Make sure you have checked the `auto update` option so you can receive future updates.
4. The selected style should be working fine from now.
5. If a new window pops out, you can close it.

If you want to install all the styles for a selected theme, simply do the same with `all-in-one.user.css` located in
each theme's directory.
